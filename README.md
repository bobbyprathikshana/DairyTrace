# DairyTrace
Introduction :
Dairy products are one of the indispensable foods in people's lives. Oftentimes people rely on store bought milk and milk products even for feeding newborns. Since the late 20th century, the agricultural/ dairy products and milk manufacturing, processing and distribution sectors have been facing numerous new challenges, such as climate change, food security, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, reports about the quality and safety of dairy products often appear. Therefore, the assurance of providing a reliable quality of milk by the producers becomes the need of the day. To address a solution to the problem, a dairy product quality and safety traceability system based on blockchain is proposed. In addition, the traceability link in the dairy supply chain is defined, and the basic framework and traceability barcode of the traceability system are designed. The system guarantees the integrity and security of the traceability information from the technical level, and provides the dairy traceability service for the government to assess the quality milk supplied to the population, enterprises to retain the brand image and consumers to guarantee trust in the product before consumption.

Application: 

Farmer
The farmer can access the system by first completing the registration process.
He can then put up the farm produce i.e various types of milk on sale. The details of the farm produce will be validated by the system to detect adulteration.


Process Owner
The process owner can access the system by first completing the registration process.
The process owner can buy the raw materials put up on sale by the farmer.
He can also put up various dairy products such as different qualities of milk etc for sale.
He can also add the products to warehouses for storage.
He can provide feedback on the orders placed.
Distributor
The distributor can access the system by first completing the registration process.
He can make entries of the distribution in the system.
He is responsible for delivering the goods from the loading location to the unloading location.

Retailer
The transporter can access the system by first completing the registration process.
Customer
The customer can access the system by first completing the registration process.
He can buy various dairy products put up on sale by the producer.
He can provide feedback on the orders placed.
Also, the customers can scan the QR code to get the details of the purchased product of milk on the portal
TECHNICAL FLOW


Acquisition Module: The data of dairy farmers, production and processing factories, logistics
companies, wholesale markets and retailers are collected through the data interface in this layer.

Data layer: Through the distributed storage of the manually entered data information and the data information collected in the embedded environment, the layer will take effect after being
stamped with a time stamp and digital signature. Once the block is formed, it cannot be tampered
with. Using IOT devices the data acquisition is carried out.

Network Module: The network layer includes the rules for authentication, node access, and the
rules for the transmission of blockchain stored information over the network.

Consensus Module: In this layer, each node on the chain verifies the algorithm of information
on the chain and ensures the consistency of information in the process of dairy product quality
and safety traceability. Consensus mechanism enhances each participant's trust in the data stored
in the blockchain.

Contract Module: It is usually composed of algorithms, scripts and smart contracts. After the
nodes in the blockchain perform some operations, if they meet the preset conditions or rules, the
smart contract will be executed automatically.

Application Module: It mainly has the functions of data acquisition, query and display. Each
members can directly query data information through a portal, APP and application interface.
This is achieved using html, css and js.
